## Yemi Adebayo

I am a life-long learner eager to kick-start a career in software development.

With experience in client services at a FinTech company (iwoca), I became curious as to how and why certain bugs developed. I reported bugs to developers in the form of tech support tickets. A developer on tech support would then liaise with me to understand where the bug was spotted and seek to find the best solution. I asked developers why certain bugs occurred so that I could understand the thought-process required to find the right solution. 

My curiosity for solving problems with code led me to Makers Academy (a 16-week coding bootcamp). After weeks of intensive study, I am able to develop programs, web and mobile apps using agile methodologies within teams. I am now keen to join a tech team who is passionate about learning and writing clean code.


## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|-|-|-|
| [Woke App](https://github.com/yem82/woke-platypus) | Makers final project. Around 20% of fatal road accidents are caused by fatigue. Keeping focus while driving long distances is difficult. The woke app is a hands-free mobile trivia app, allowing drivers to use voice to answer questions read out to them. | Java, Android Studio, Circle CI |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/yem82/acebook-spacebook) | Team project. Built a Facebook clone using CICD | Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, Heroku, Travis CI, RSpec, Capybara |
| [Notes](https://github.com/yem82/notes) | Team Project. Built a single-page, note-taking web app.| Vanilla JS, HTML, customised testing framework |

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2019 to July 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code.

I am continously working on my craft to become a better software engineer. At Makers, I have learnt how to code with best coding practices. Code is written using test-driven development (TDD) and following object oriented principles (OOP) to produce DRY and flexible code.

I have furthed my study of clean code by reading books such as Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Authored by Robert C. Martin) and Practical Object-Oriented Design (Sandi Metz).

- Fast, independent learner

Makers has provided me with the tools to become a self-directed learner. 

During the course we had a day to learn any new language we desired. I chose Python and decided to challenge myself by test-driving a fizzbuzz program. I learnt how to do unit testing and write code to pass tests with python (unittest)

Another example of my fast learning was with the speed I was able to learn how to use javascript to manipulate the DOM in the VanillaJS [Notes_App](https://github.com/yem82/notes) 

- Great collaborator

The emotional intelligence (EI) curriculum at Makers helped me develop a deeper understanding of empathy, feedback and team communication. 


Collaboration was especially important during our final team project. I understood that there were many ways to achieve the same result for speech-to-text functionality. I listened to each team-member's opinion for the direction to take and weighed out the positives and potential blockers we will face. I researched Dialogflow API, which has Google Assistant built-in. The team agreed to integrate this API with our app to allow users to respond to questions with their voice.
