## Yemi Adebayo

I am a life-long learner eager to kick-start a career in software development.

With experience in client services at a FinTech company (iwoca), I became curious as to how and why certain bugs developed. I reported bugs to developers in the form of tech support tickets. A developer on tech support would then liaise with me to understand where the bug was spotted and seek to find the best solution. I asked developers why certain bugs occurred so that I could understand the thought-process required to find the right solution. 

My curiosity for solving problems with code led me to Makers Academy (a 16-week coding bootcamp). After weeks of intensive study, I am able to develop programs, web and mobile apps using agile methodologies within teams. I am now keen to join a tech team who is passionate about learning and writing clean code.
