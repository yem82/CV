## Yemi Adebayo

I am a life-long learner eager to kick-start a career in software development.

With experience in client services at a FinTech company (iwoca), I became curious as to how and why certain bugs developed. I reported bugs to developers in the form of tech support tickets. A developer on tech support would then liaise with me to understand where the bug was spotted and seek to find the best solution. I asked developers why certain bugs occurred so that I could understand the thought-process required to find the right solution. 

My curiosity for solving problems with code led me to Makers Academy (a 16-week coding bootcamp). After weeks of intensive study, I am able to develop programs, web and mobile apps using agile methodologies within teams. I am now keen to join a tech team who is passionate about learning and writing clean code.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2019 to July 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code.

Object oriented principles
writing clean code
reading books such as A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Authored by Robert C. Martin) 
and Practical Object-Oriented Design (Sandi Metz) to assist learning

- Fast, independent learner

Makers has provided me with the tools to become a self-directed learner. 

During the course we had a day to learn any new language we desired. I chose Python and decided to challenge myself by test-driving a fizzbuzz program. I learnt how to do unit testing and write code to pass tests with python (unittest)

Another example, is with the speed I was able to learn how to use javascript to manipulate the DOM 
Vanilla Javascript notes app

- Great collaborator

The emotional intelligence (EI) curriculum at Makers helped me develop a deeper understanding of empathy, feedback and team communication. 
Collaboration was especially important during our final team project. I understood that there were many ways to achieve the same result for speech-to-text functionality. I listened to each team-member's opinion of the direction to take and weighed out the positives and potential blockers we will face. I researched Dialogflow API, which has Google Assistant built-in. The team agreed to integrate the API with our app to allow users to respond to questions with their voice.
